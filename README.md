# Skype Network Analysis with Wireshark and Python by Sebastian and Alexandra

This repository contains network analysis of Skype traffic performed by Sebastian and Alexandra, using Wireshark and Python.

## Project Description

In this project, we analyzed the network traffic generated by Skype calls and messages to gain insights into the communication patterns and protocols used by Skype. We used Wireshark to capture and analyze the network traffic, and Python to write scripts to parse and analyze the captured data.

## Data

The data we used was captured using Wireshark during Skype calls/video calls and messaging sessions. The captured data includes packet headers and payloads, as well as protocol information.

## Methods

We used Wireshark to capture and analyze the Skype network traffic, and Python to write scripts to parse and analyze the captured data. We performed several analyses on the data, including:

- Protocol analysis to identify the protocols used by Skype
- Packet analysis to identify the types of packets and their content
- Conversation analysis to identify the participants and the duration of Skype calls

We also created visualizations to help understand the data and its patterns.

## Files

- `ALLUME`: Captured network traffic of packets generated when starting the application with different network use (4G, Ethernet, WiFi).
- `APPEL`: Captured network traffic of packets generated during calls with different network use (4G, Ethernet, WiFi).
- `VIDEO`:  Captured network traffic of packets generated during video usage with different network use (4G, Ethernet, WiFi).
- `sameWIFI`:  Captured network traffic of packets generated during video, chat and call usage with same network use (WiFi).
- `PYTHON_SCRIPTS`:  Scripts written in Python to perform network traffic analysis and graphs.


## Credits

This project was completed by Sebastian and Alexandra, with guidance from our instructor. We would like to thank the Wireshark and Python communities for their contributions to the tools and libraries we used.
