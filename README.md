# Skype Network Analysis with Wireshark and Python by Sebastian and Alexandra

This repository contains network analysis of Skype traffic performed by Sebastian and Alexandra, using Wireshark and Python.

## Project Description

In this project, we analyzed the network traffic generated by Skype calls and messages to gain insights into the communication patterns and protocols used by Skype. We used Wireshark to capture and analyze the network traffic, and Python to write scripts to parse and analyze the captured data.

## Data

The data we used was captured using Wireshark during Skype calls and messaging sessions. The captured data includes packet headers and payloads, as well as protocol information.

## Methods

We used Wireshark to capture and analyze the Skype network traffic, and Python to write scripts to parse and analyze the captured data. We performed several analyses on the data, including:

- Protocol analysis to identify the protocols used by Skype
- Packet analysis to identify the types of packets and their content
- Conversation analysis to identify the participants and the duration of Skype calls

We also created visualizations to help understand the data and its patterns.

## Files

- `skype_analysis.py`: Python script for analyzing the captured Skype network traffic.
- `skype_traffic.pcap`: Captured network traffic generated by Skype calls and messages.
- `skype_analysis_report.pdf`: Report summarizing the findings of our analysis.

## How to Use

To run the analysis, you will need to have Wireshark and Python installed on your system. 

1. Open `skype_traffic.pcap` in Wireshark and filter for Skype traffic.
2. Export the filtered traffic as a .csv file.
3. Run `skype_analysis.py` to analyze the exported .csv file and generate the report.

## Credits

This project was completed by Sebastian and Alexandra, with guidance from our instructor. We would like to thank the Wireshark and Python communities for their contributions to the tools and libraries we used.
